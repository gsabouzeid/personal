Homework assignments from CSCI 1133 - Introduction to Computing and Programming Concepts
Took in the Spring of 2020 taught by Nathan Taylor

Homework assignments include:

  HW1: Purpose of the assignment was to fix errors within the code and make it work as intended. Learned the basics of creating variables and print statements.
  
  HW2: Learned the basics of user-defined functions and its purpose. Also learned the basics of turtle graphics in Python.
  
  HW3: Learned how to call functions within functions. Learned if-elif-else statements and created and adventure text game using if statements.
  
  HW4: Learned for, while, and nexted loops. Created a rock-paper-scissors game using while loops and if statements.
  
  HW5: Learned lists and list manipulation.
  
  HW6: Learned nested lists and matrices. Used matrices to represent pixels in an image. Created algorithms to change pixel colors of an image. Algorithms include: red_blue_swap (swap the red and blue values in the pixel), grayscale (changes pixels to gray values), and split (splits the image to 4 copies of itself, the 4 copies combined are the same dimensions of the original image). The transform_image(fname, operation) takes in a image (.bmp file) and a operation that will perform on the image and will output the image after the operation has been called and made.
  
  HW7: Learned how strings work. Created an encrypt(message, encoding) function that takes in a message and an encoding cipher that will encrypt the message. Created a decrypt(message, encoding) function that takes in a encrypted message and decrypts it using the encoding cipher. Created a longest common subsequence algorithm that returns the longest common subsequence of two given strings. Created a function that translates a given string into Pig Latin.
  
  HW8: Learned file i/o. Created a rotate_model(fname_in, fname_out) function that takes in an object file (.obj) and rotates the object 90 degrees. Created a function get_data_list(fname) that extracts data from a CSV file as a list of rows. Created a get_col_index(row1_str, col_title) function that finds the column index given the column title. Also learned how to change values in a CSV file by writing to the file.
  
  HW9: Learned dictionaries. Created a function combine(d1,d2) that combines two dictionaries into one and has elements from both dictionaries. Created a function first_words(fname) that takes in a text file and finds the first words of each sentence and puts it in a dictionary. Created a function next_words(fname) that takes in a text file and creates a dictionary that keeps track of what words come after each word and how many times they do so. These two functions are used in the function fanfic(fname) that prints a random 10 sentence fanfiction from words from an inputed text file.
