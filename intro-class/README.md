Homework assignments from CSCI 1133 - Introduction to Computing and Programming Concepts
Took in the Spring of 2020

Homework assignments include:

  HW1: Purpose of the assignment was to fix errors within the code and make it work as intended. Learned the basics of creating variables and print statements.
  
  HW2: Learned the basics of user-defined functions and its purpose. Also learned the basics of turtle graphics in Python.
  
  HW3: Learned how to call functions within functions. Learned if-elif-else statements and created and adventure text game using if statements.
  
  HW4: Learned for, while, and nexted loops. Created a rock-paper-scissors game using while loops and if statements.
  
  HW5: Learned lists and list manipulation.
  
  HW6: Learned nested lists and matrices. Used matrices to represent pixels in an image and altered the pixel values to alter the image in various ways.
  
  HW7: Learned how strings work in Python and how to iterate through strings.
  
  HW8: Learned file i/o. Created a function that rotates an object from an .obj file and another function that accesses data from a .csv file.
  
  HW9: Learned dictionaries. Created a function that combines 2 dictionaries into 1, and another function that creates a dictionary based on a .txt file that is inputted.
  
  HW10: Learned recursion and created functions that call itself.
  
  HW11: Learned about objects and classes. Learned the idea of object-oriented programming (OOP).
  
  HW12: Learned inheritance and created classes that inherit from other classes.
  
  HW13: Final HW of the class. Created a snake game that involves everything that we learned in class, with the focus of creating the game using classes.
