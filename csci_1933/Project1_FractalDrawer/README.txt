Project 1
Created by: Garrett Abou-Zeid (abouz009)

How to compile and run program:
1. Open the command prompt and go to the directory where project 1 is located.
2. Compile the project by calling, "javac FractalDrawer.java".
3. Run the program by calling "java FractalDrawer".
4. It will prompt you to type in a shape (circle, triangle or rectangle) 
   that will become a fractal and will draw it on a canvas.

Assumptions:
- A warning message appears when first compiling the program.
  It reads, "Note: .\Canvas.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
             Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details."
  Assume the program works perfectly fine.

Additional Features:
- Changed the draw*SHAPE*Fractal methods to return a double representing the
  total area of the fractal instead of returning nothing.

Known bugs/defects: N/A
