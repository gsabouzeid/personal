Project 5 - Hash Table
Created by: Garrett Abou-Zeid (abouz009)
Created in: IntelliJ

How to compile and run program (Using IntelliJ):
Open the HashTable.java file in IntelliJ and click the run button. 
It will display both the general case (gettysburg.txt) and the 
specific case (keywords.txt), each with their own metrics.

How to use the different hash functions:
	1. Find the add() method in the source code.
	2. Change hash# with a different hash function provided.
	3. The length of the hash table can also be modified at
	   the top of the main method.

Assusmptions: 
We are assummng that the best function (hash4) is being used on both cases.

Additional/Special Features:
-Modified TextScan.java and implemented it for use in the main method of HashTable.java
-Added statistics for each hash function, which represents the best scenerio for each text file.

Known bugs/defects:
